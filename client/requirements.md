## Packages
framer-motion | Animations for smooth transitions and interactions
date-fns | Date formatting and manipulation for delivery dates

## Notes
Mobile-first design approach.
Role-based views (Foreman, Supplier, Driver).
Using Google Fonts: 'Chakra Petch' for headers (industrial feel) and 'Inter' for body.
